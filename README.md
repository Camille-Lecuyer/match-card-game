## Download and install necessary programs

- .Net Framework Developer Pack: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48
- .Net 8.0: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0 (SDK 8.0.301)

## Run the program

Open Command Prompt, navigate to the match-src directory and run
> dotnet build

Navigate to match-src directory and run:
> dotnet run -- 

Run the tests from match-test directory:
> dotnet test

## Notes
I took the liberty to add more output to the console to gain a better understanding of the program. 
I've also added the possibility to re-run the program easily after the last execution for ease of testing.
